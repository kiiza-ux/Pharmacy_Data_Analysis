# **Pharmacy Dispensing Analysis â€“ Mawenzi Regional Referral Hospital**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes **pharmacy dispensing trends** at **Mawenzi Regional Referral Hospital**, using data extracted from the **Afya EHMS** (Electronic Health Management System). The analysis explores **medication utilization, patient demographics, insurance coverage (NHIF vs. Cash), and dispensing trends over time**. The insights gained can aid in **inventory optimization, resource allocation, and policy decision-making** to enhance pharmaceutical services.  

## **Objectives**  
ðŸ”¹ **Identify the most dispensed medications** to guide procurement and stock management.  
ðŸ”¹ **Analyze dispensing trends over time** to detect seasonal patterns and variations.  
ðŸ”¹ **Examine patient demographics (age, gender, clinic type)** to understand healthcare demand.  .  
ðŸ”¹ **Investigate the utilization of non-drug medical items** (e.g., syringes, IV fluids).  
ðŸ”¹ **Provide actionable recommendations** for improving hospital pharmacy operations.  

## **Dataset Overview**
